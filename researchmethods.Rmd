# Considerations
## Delimitations
1. Data source
2. Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institution

## Limitations
1. Secondary data
2. COVID

## Assumptions
1. Budget constraint exist

???
<!--presenter notes -->
delimitation:
1. recent data required, only a few resources for that
 - avoid pay wall - even fewer
 - keep constant - use one
2. sponsor and donor revenue for FCS = 12% in 2022; or approx $155M

limitation:
1. validity (maintained by credible source)
2. some proxy measure of sponsorship spending in pro sports can be used as control

Assumption:
1. zero sum game - this theory will be tested
