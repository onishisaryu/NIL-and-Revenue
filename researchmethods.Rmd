# The impact of NIL on donor and sponsor revenue of U.S. college athletic departments.

## HES Proposal Presentation

# Background
## History of Name, Image and Likeness (NIL)
Does the NCAA's amateurism rules violate antitrust laws?
- **2014:** O'Bannon v. NCAA
 - First major challenge to NCAA's amateurism rules
- **2019:** Fair Pay to Play Act passed in CA
 - Planned to take effect in 2023
- **2021:** NCAA v. Alston
 - Breakthrough case

???
<!--presenter notes -->
obannon:
- argument
- outcome:

fairpay:
- argument: allow students to recieve sponsorship/endorsements while maintaining NCAA eligibility
- outcome: in effect, 2023, many states followed

alston:
- argument: could lead to "pay-for-play" (NCAA) - rejected by courts
- outcome:

# Background - continued
## College Athletic Department Revenue
.pull-left[
<img src="revenue_sample_edit.png" alt="college athletics revenue">
<small>Example of Revenue breakdown (FBS, 2022)</small>

]

.pull-right[
Donor and Sponsor revenue in 2022 was approximately:
- 30% of total revenue
- $ 2.8 Billion
]

# Purpose of the Study

Investigate the impact of NIL policy changes on the sponsor and donor revenue of university athletics departments.

Potential impacts:
- Motivate universities to regulate NIL
- Demonstrate the fact that college sports sponsorship is not a zero-sum game
---

# Research Questions

1. Has the introduction of **NIL** compensation in college sports impacted the **sponsorship and donation revenue** streams of university athletics departments in the United States?

  - How has the sponsorship and donation revenue streams of university athletics departments in the United States changed after the implementation of NIL policies?
  - How does the changes in sponsorship and donation revenue of university athletics departments compare with the changes in sponsorship and donation revenue of professional leagues?

# Considerations
.pull-left[
## Delimitations
1. Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institution
2. Time frame (2016 - 2022)
 - 5 years pre-NIL, 1 year post-NIL
 - (New data publishes in October)
 
## Limitations
1. NIL impacts may be difficult to detect
2. COVID
 - Similar timeline as NIL decisions
]
.pull-right[
## Assumptions
1. Sponsorship spending patterns similar across pro and college sports
2. Data is accurate
]
???
<!--notes -->
delimitation:
1. recent data required, only a few resources for that
 - avoid pay wall - even fewer
 - keep constant - use one
2. more money in FBS (sponsor, donor, NIL)
 - sponsor and donor revenue for FCS = 12% in 2022; or approx $155M

limitation:
1. validity (maintained by credible source)
2. some proxy measure of sponsorship spending in pro sports can be used as control

Assumption:
1. Accuracy of data

# Operational Definitions
Define any key terms used in the study.

- Donation:
- Endorsement:
- NIL: 
- Sponsorship:

# Literature
## Athletic Department Revenue
1. Total revenue is growing due increasing allocated revenue and revenue from television right, ticket, sponsors and donors.
 - McEvoy et al., 2013
 - Jablonski et al., 2022

2. Sponsors and donors may redirect spending towards student athletes to reach fans directly
 - Dees et al., 2021
 - Petersen & Judge, 2021
 
---
# Literature
## Impact of NIL on Revenue
1. Many student athletes can capitalize on their NIL
 - Kunkel et al., 2021
 - Cocco & Moorman, 2022

2. Limited research, many speculative
 - Dees et al., 2021
 - Petersen & Judge, 2021

# Literature
## Research methods
Jablonski, T., Jensen, J. A., Popp, N., & Bates, B. (2022). Identifying and Analyzing Determinants of Allocated Revenue to NCAA FBS Athletic Departments. *Journal of Issues in Intercollegiate Athletics*, 15, 506-531.
- OLS multiple linear regression model to predict Allocated Revenue
- Data collected from multiple secondary sources, including knightnewhousedata.org


Current study will be focused on the $\beta_n$ instead of the outcome variable as Jablonski et al. did in their paper.

???
Data includes:
- Grad rates, 
- Ticket sales,
- Director cup points,
- conference membership

---
# Research Design
Causal-comparative research design
- How NIL impacted sponsor and donor revenue of college athletic departments
 - 2016~2020 data = pre-NIL, 2021~2022 data = post-NIL

###Threat to validity:
- History: 
  - COVID is a confounding variable
- Sample selection
  - limited generalizability
???
Policy change in june - 2021 categorization is open for debate

# Methods
## Data sources
- knightnewhousedata.org
 - Maintained by Syracuse University
- Other sources TBD
 - Data Triangulation to ensure validity

---
# Methods
## Data Collection
Independent Variables:

| Variable | Sources | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| NIL | Various | Status of NIL policy. Pre (0) or post (1) |
| Performance | Various | Athletic performance in previous year |
| COVID | Various | Number of reported COVID related hospitalization in the US |
| Group | NCAA | Group of 5 (0) or Power 5 (1) |

Dependent Variable:

| Variable | Sources | Description |
|----------|----------|----------|
| $\Delta Revenue_y$ | knightnewhousedata.org | $Revenue_{y+1} - Revenue_y$ |

---
# Methods
## Data Analysis
Multiple regression model will be used to calculate the $\beta$ coefficient of the NIl variable and the other control variables:
$$\Delta Revenue = \beta_0 + \beta_1 NIL + \beta_2 Performance + \beta_4 COVID + \epsilon$$
Additional analysis taking conference membership nto account
$$\Delta Revenue = \beta_0 + \beta_1 NIL + \beta_2 Performance + \beta_4 COVID + \beta_5 Group + \epsilon$$
